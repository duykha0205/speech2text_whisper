 I want to talk with you a bit about we are not just producing chitosan, but the main part of our company is that we are producing the string protein hydrolasein, which can be a protein source for the animal feed. We are already selling a lot of our string protein hydrolasein to the animal feed in Vietnam, even for the chicken or the leiyas, and we receive very good feedback. So we have a quick study, we talked about NNN, and we see that they have the farm, they raise the leiyas for producing the chicken and the eggs, so we think that it might be interesting for them to introduce two other products, the string protein hydrolasein.

 and the anti-oxidant that gives the red pigment for the york. Sure, because for NNN, of course they are producing their own peat at the farm, so they do need ingredients for the peat as well, but for the purpose of today's meeting, I think we can focus more on the kailosan first, which is a non-peat product, because for the peat, it's a bit complicated for its operation. So once there's a success story for the kailosan, then it's easier for us to move on to other products, so it's not too complicated for Mr Ma as well. So that is my opinion based on my experience working with NNN. Okay, so we first focus on the kailosan for the egg. Yes, that's right.

Hey, next week I'm coming to Malaysia, but please, traveling as well. I know that you will be away, you will be in Dubai, right? I'll be in Dubai, yes, yes. So, because I have something very important. Today, sorry, 2.30pm on Thursday. I believe you are coming back on Wednesday. Usually I will go to see Steven, in case if we want to catch up, maybe the only time is late Wednesday or early Thursday. It's up to you, because I know you are traveling, you will be tired.

 We can do a quick Zoom wrap up actually. Sure, sure. At this stage, I think if you can get some sort of working method with Stephen, that's the most important thing. That's what I plan to do, you know, because he has a lot of ideas. Every time you ask Stephen something, he will send you, I think, 20 messages at least. And a lot of documents. You ask one question, you have like 20 responses. Yes, the key thing I think is how to structure the marketing campaign. Absolutely, and also the corporations and, you know, my market as well. Because we will have Vietnam market, we have Thailand and other markets. Yes, yes, yes. More marketing thing. I don't necessarily have to be in that discussion actually.

So far initially, we are, Vunty and I plan to fly to Singapore maybe for one day, after that we take a bus and then fly to Malaysia. But finally because the flight schedule is very tight. It's okay, no worries, I will always be here, so we can always catch up on your next trip. Sure. Because if we do fly, then you have to work with us on Sunday, which is terrible for you. On Sunday? So, what do I think? Yeah, it's okay for me, but I think Matthew will be around.
